    <!-- Irony: Lottery Death. -->
    <article class="irony" data-js-irony="money">
        <h1>Lottery Death</h1>
        <blockquote>
            An old man turned 98. He won the lottery and died the next day.
        </blockquote>
        <h2>Assessment: Ironic</h2>
        <p>
            Since you would expect somebody who just won the lottery to enjoy their winnings for some amount of time,
            it is unexpected and striking that instead he should die before getting the chance to,
            making this an example of irony.
        </p>
        <p>
            The initial mention of the man being "old" and "98" does somewhat diminish the expectation,
            but it could also be seen from the perspective that he finally got something good after waiting
            patiently for so long, and thus could even be taken as ironic from this perspective.

    <!-- Irony: Fly in Chardonnay. -->
    <article class="irony" data-js-irony="drink">
        <h1>Fly in Chardonnay</h1>
        <blockquote>
            It's a black fly in your Chardonnay.
        </blockquote>
        <h2>Assessment: Not Ironic</h2>
        <p>
            This is just an unfortunate occurrence that is somewhat common.
            There is even a related clich√© ("you catch more flies with honey than with vinegar").

    <!-- Irony: Death Row Pardon. -->
    <article class="irony" data-js-irony="clock">
        <h1>Death Row Pardon</h1>
        <blockquote>
            It's a death row pardon two minutes too late.
        </blockquote>
        <h2>Assessment: Ironic</h2>
        <p>
            Clearly ironic. You would expect a pardon to occur before the sentence is carried out.
            The tragic consequences make it more striking.

    <!-- Irony: Wedding Rain. -->
    <article class="irony" data-js-irony="ring">
        <h1>Rain on Wedding Day</h1>
        <blockquote>
            It's like rain on your wedding day
        </blockquote>
        <h2>Assessment: Not Ironic</h2>
        <p>
            While some might see the juxtaposition of what should be your happiest day being ruined as ironic,
            the truth is that rain on a wedding day is a commonplace occurrence, and so is more just unfortunate
            than ironic.
